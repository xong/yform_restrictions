# Load project addon late to be sure that
#   - all other addons are booted before
#   - the fragments from project addon are always "winning" over other fragment dirs
#   - language keys of other addons can be overridden
#   - ...

# Don't use `load: late` in public addons, rely on redaxo's default order resolution (by dependencies) instead
